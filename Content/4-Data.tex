\chapter{Data}
In the wake of the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, the major credit institues of the U.S. were demanded to share their data with the public to make their credit worthiness more clear. Thus we have the fredie mac signle familiy loan level dataset, which i have chosen to analysis in this thesis. The dataset spans the years 1999 through 2018, embedding more than 27 million 30 year fixed rate mortage, however due to lack of computational power, the sample is of only $50.000$ draws each year, resulting in around $900.000$ unique loans, and $150.000.000$ monthly observations.
