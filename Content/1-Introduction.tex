\chapter{Introduction}
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has in recent years become more and more popular and a key-capability for many employers when hiring new employees. The popularity arises from the results these algorithms have shown together with the increased availability of the computing power required by these algorithms. However, AI is actually not a new invention, it was born in the 1950s (se depp learning with R, p. 2).... 
AI is a very broad terms and includes for example the sub >>Machine Learning<< in which >>Deep Learning<< is another sub group. Deep Learning, is another set of algorithms where one of them is the Artifical Neural Network (ANN), which will be the turning point of this thesis.
