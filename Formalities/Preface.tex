I am convinced that machines can and will think. I don't mean that machines will behave like men. I don't think for a very long time we are going to have a difficult problem distinguishing a man from a robot. And I don't think my daughter will ever marry a computer. But I think that computers will be doing the things that men do when we say they are thinking. I am convinced that machines can and will think in our lifetime.\\
