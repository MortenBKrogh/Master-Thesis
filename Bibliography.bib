  abstract={Fixed Income Modelling offers a unified presentation of dynamic term structure models and their applications to the pricing and risk management of fixed income securities. It explains the basic fixed income securities and their properties and uses as well as the relations between those securities. The book presents and compares the classical affine models, Heath-Jarrow-Morton models, and LIBOR market models, and demonstrates how to apply those models for the pricing of various widely traded fixed income securities. It offers a balanced presentation with both formal mathematical modelling and economic intuition and understanding. The book has a number of distinctive features including a thorough and accessible introduction to stochastic processes and the stochastic calculus needed for the modern financial modelling approach used in the book, as well as a separate chapter that explains how the term structure of interest rates relates to macro-economic variables and to what extent the concrete interest rate models are founded in general economic theory. The book focuses on the most widely used models and the main fixed income securities, instead of trying to cover all the many specialized models and the countless exotic real-life products. The in-depth explanation of the main pricing principles, techniques, and models as well as their application to the most important types of securities will enable the reader to understand and apply other models and price other securities. The book includes chapters on interest rate risk management, credit risk, mortgage-backed securities, and relevant numerical techniques. Each chapter concludes with a number of exercises of varying complexity. Suitable for MSc students specializing in finance and economics, quantitatively oriented MBA students, and first- or second-year PhD students, this book will also be a useful reference for researchers and finance professionals and can be used in specialized courses on fixed income or broader c},

A growing body of literature recognizes the substantial lag between the time that a borrower stops making payments on a mortgage and the termination of the loan. The duration of this lag and the method by which the delinquency is ultimately terminated play a critical role in the costs borne by both borrower and lender. Using nested and multinomial logit, we find that delinquency and default are sensitive to current economic conditions and housing markets. Credit scores and loan characteristics also play important roles.},

We estimate a two-stage competing risk hazard model to assess the factors associated with post-default outcomes, including whether a borrower receives a legal notice of foreclosure. In particular, we focus on a borrower’s ability to avoid a foreclosure auction by getting a modification, by refinancing the loan, or by selling the property. We find that the outcomes of the foreclosure process are significantly related to: loan characteristics including the borrower’s credit history, current loan-to-value and the presence of a junior lien; the borrower’s post-default payment behavior, including the borrower’s participation in foreclosure counseling; neighborhood characteristics such as foreclosure rates, recent house price depreciation and median income; and the borrower’s race and ethnicity.

@book{hebb1949,
  abstract = {{Donald Hebb pioneered many current themes in
                 behavioural neuroscience. He saw psychology as a
                 biological science, but one in which the organization
                 of behaviour must remain the central concern. Through
                 penetrating theoretical concepts, including the "cell
                 assembly," "phase sequence," and "Hebb synapse," he
                 offered a way to bridge the gap between cells, circuits
                 and behaviour. He saw the brain as a dynamically
                 organized system of multiple distributed parts, with
                 roots that extend into foundations of development and
                 evolutionary heritage. He understood that behaviour, as
                 brain, can be sliced at various levels and that one of
                 our challenges is to bring these levels into both
                 conceptual and empirical register. He could move
                 between theory and fact with an ease that continues to
                 inspire both students and professional investigators.
                 Although facts continue to accumulate at an
                 accelerating rate in both psychology and neuroscience,
                 and although these facts continue to force revision in
                 the details of Hebb's earlier contributions, his
                 overall insistence that we look at behaviour and brain
                 together â within a dynamic, relational and
                 multilayered framework â remains. His work touches
                 upon current studies of population coding, contextual
                 factors in brain representations, synaptic plasticity,
                 developmental construction of brain/behaviour
                 relations, clinical syndromes, deterioration of
                 performance with age and disease, and the formal
                 construction of connectionist models. The collection of
                 papers in this volume represent these and related
                 themes that Hebb inspired. We also acknowledge our
                 appreciation for Don Hebb as teacher, colleague and

The procedure repeatedly adjusts the weights of the connections in the network so as to minimize a measure of the difference between the actual output vector of the net and the desired output vector. As a result of the weight adjustments, internal `hidden'units which are not part of the input or output come to represent important features of the task domain, and the regularities in the task are captured by the interactions of these units. The ability to create useful new features distinguishes back-propagation from earlier, simpler methods such as the perceptron-convergence procedure1.},

	Abstract = {Digital circuits such as the flip-flop use feedback to achieve multi-stability and nonlinearity to restore signals to logical levels, for example 0 and 1. Analogue feedback circuits are generally designed to operate linearly, so that signals are over a range, and the response is unique. By contrast, the response of cortical circuits to sensory stimulation can be both multistable and graded1,2,3,4. We propose that the neocortex combines digital selection of an active set of neurons with analogue response by dynamically varying the positive feedback inherent in its recurrent connections. Strong positive feedback causes differential instabilities that drive the selection of a set of active neurons under the constraints embedded in the synaptic weights. Once selected, the active neurons generate weaker, stable feedback that provides analogue amplification of the input. Here we present our model of cortical processing as an electronic circuit that emulates this hybrid operation, and so is able to perform computations that are similar to stimulus selection, gain modulation and spatiotemporal pattern generation in the neocortex.},
